                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away
your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of
a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free
Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software;
it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply
it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute
copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source
code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces
of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights
or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities
if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities
to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.

Streamlabs Terms of Service


The section titled “Disputes” contains an arbitration clause and class-action waiver
that applies to certain users. Please read this section carefully as it significantly

Paid Services And Fees; Gift Subscriptions Terms and Conditions

Paid Services and Fees. Certain Services are paid services. This section explains how
we handle payments for those paid services. For certain paid services, such as domain
registrations and subscriptions, we’ll automatically bill you in regular intervals
(such as monthly or annually) unless you cancel your subscription. You can do that
anytime through our customer support or by emailing support@streamlabs.com. Key
information relating to subscriptions will be set out in the order process. 

Gift Subscriptions. The following Gift Subscription Terms and Conditions  describe
the terms and conditions that apply to the use of Streamlabs gift subscriptions
(“Gift Subscription”). This Agreement is between you (the “Gift Subscription Holder”)
and Logitech Services S.A. (“Streamlabs”)

Gift Subscription Basics. Gift Subscriptions are pre-purchases of a subscription to
the Streamlabs Ultra service, available at www.streamlabs.com (the “Service”). To
redeem, the Gift Subscription Holder must either be an existing Streamlabs member or
create an account with Streamlabs and accept its Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
Gift Subscriptions are not gift cards, debit cards or credit cards. Gift
Subscriptions may be issued in either electronic or physical form at Streamlabs’
discretion.

Subscription Period. Gift Subscriptions are denominated in a specified number of
months of subscription to the Streamlabs services. The full subscription period will
be credited to the Gift Subscription Holder’s Streamlabs account upon redemption of
the Gift Subscription. Gift Subscriptions are not denominated in U.S. Dollars and
have no cash value.

Expiration; Fees; Deactivation; Resale. Gift Subscriptions do not expire. No fees for
inactivity or service fees apply. Streamlabs reserves the right to refuse to honor
any Gift Subscription in the event of a disputed credit card charge, bounced check or
other failure of consideration. Gift Subscriptions cannot be resold. Gift
Subscriptions are valid only if obtained through www.streamlabs.com. Gift
Subscriptions are not valid and will not be honoured and Streamlabs will not be
liable, if obtained from unauthorised sellers or resellers, including through
Internet auction sites.

Redemption. Gift Subscriptions are redeemable only for a subscription to the
Streamlabs services available at www.st. Gift Subscriptions may not be exchanged or
redeemed for cash unless required by law. Gift Subscriptions are not redeemable to
purchase another Gift Subscription or towards previously purchased subscriptions
(i.e., a credited subscription period due to redemption of a Gift Subscription will
be appended to the end of a previously purchased subscription).

Refunds. Unless as required by applicable law in your jurisdiction, within the first
90 days after the date of purchase of a Gift Subscription and if not yet redeemed for
a subscription, at the Gift Subscription Holder’s option, we will refund the full
amount of the purchase of a Gift Subscription to the purchaser of the Gift
Subscription. Refunds are not available 90 days after the purchase date of a Gift
Subscription, or if already redeemed for a subscription. Refunds are not available
for accounts which have violated this Agreement; violations are determined at the
sole discretion of Streamlabs. If Streamlabs determines that the Gift Subscription
Holder is abusing this refund policy, we reserve the right to refuse or restrict any
and all current or future use of the Service without delivering a refund. To request
a refund or to ask a question, email Support at support@streamlabs.com

Accuracy Of Billing And Account Information

You agree to provide current, complete, and accurate purchase and account information
for all transactions occurring on our Service. You agree to promptly update your
account and other information so that we can complete your transactions and contact
you as needed.

Fees

We have the right to make changes to the fees for Services from time to time,
although any changes shall apply only prospectively.  If these changes result in an
increase in the fees payable by you, we shall inform you at least thirty (30) days in
advance of the change. If you do not agree to pay the increased fees, you may
terminate your subscription in accordance with Section 5 of these  terms
(“Termination”).

Taxes

Except where a different presentation is required by applicable law, fees are
exclusive of applicable national, provincial, state, local or other taxes (“Taxes”),
unless explicitly stated otherwise. You’re responsible for all applicable Taxes, and
we’ll charge Taxes in addition to the fees for the Services when required to do so.
If you’re exempt from Taxes, you must provide us with valid tax exemption
documentation. We reserve the right to determine if the documentation provided is
valid. Tax exemption will, provided we’re satisfied it’s valid and applicable, only
apply from and after the date we receive such documentation. If we has a legal
obligation to pay or collect indirect Taxes (such as value-added tax or goods and
services tax) on the sale to you under the laws of your country (where you are
established, have a permanent address or usually reside), you shall be liable for
payment of any such indirect Taxes. Where we do not have a legal obligation to pay or
collect indirect Taxes on a sale of Paid Services to you, you may be required to
self-assess those Taxes under the applicable laws of your country (where you are
established, have a permanent address or usually resides).

Automatic Subscription Renewals

Your subscription may have a minimum term. If it does, you will be informed of this
prior to checkout. That minimum term is called the “Initial Period” of your
subscription. Your subscription will continue in effect for the Initial Period and,
thereafter, it will automatically renew for successive periods equal in time to the
renewal period of your current subscription (each such period is a “Renewal Period”).
For example, if you’re on an annual subscription plan, each billable renewal period
will be for one (1) year. To ensure uninterrupted service, we’ll automatically charge
you the applicable amount using the payment method you have on file with us. This
means that your subscription continues to roll over and remains in effect unless and
until you actively choose to end it (this is without prejudice to any applicable
cancellation rights you may have). We’ll let you know in advance if you’re purchasing
a Paid Service that includes auto-renewal payments.

You can disable auto-renewal at any time via the Services or emailing customer
support at support@streamlabs.com

Refunds

NB. This section “Refunds” does not apply to Consumers resident in the UK. Please
refer to your country appendix for additional provisions that apply.

While you may cancel any Paid Services at any time, you are only eligible for a
refund if:

(i) you have not used any Paid Features contained within the Paid Service and

(ii) you have requested a refund within the applicable refund window.

The refund window is within 14 days of purchase for Streamlabs Pro, and 7 days of
purchase for all other Paid Services. Paid Features are all features for which we
incur third party fees when you use them, including without limitation Creator Sites,
Domains, Themes, and Apps.

We may deny your refund request at our sole discretion if we find evidence of fraud,
refund abuse (such as repeatedly using then refunding Streamlabs products, even if
you have only used non-paid features), or unlawful or unethical conduct.

Switching from Monthly to Yearly Subscription 

You can switch from a monthly to an annual subscription plan at any time after your
seventh (7th) day of your monthly subscription start date. Your annual subscription
will automatically renew one (1) year after the subscription change to annual date.
On the subscription change to annual date, you will be billed a pro-rated amount
based on the number of days you have left in your prior monthly subscription cycle.
For example, if you started your monthly subscription on July 1, 2023 and you decide
to switch to an annual subscription on July 10, 2023 and you have twenty (20) days
left in your monthly subscription cycle, you will be billed the annual subscription
fee less the corresponding amount for the twenty (20) days left in your monthly
billing cycle. We’ll automatically charge you the applicable amount using the payment
method you have on file with us and you will receive a confirmation email with the
receipt. By agreeing to switch from a monthly to an annual subscription plan, you are
not eligible for a refund.

charges at the prices then in effect for any purchase in accordance with the
applicable payment terms. You agree to make the payment using the payment method you

In the event a Chargeback is issued, you are immediately liable for the full amount
of the transaction related to the Chargeback. You are also liable for any associated

expenses will be deducted from your Streamlabs or Campaign balance.

If our payment processors determine you are incurring excessive Chargebacks, you may
receive additional controls and restrictions on your balance.

policies that those third-party services determine, and they may be non-refundable.
The purchase terms and conditions for such third-party services may be displayed

obtain a refund for a third-party service. Unless otherwise stated in this Agreement,
we don’t offer refunds for purchases of third-party services.

Indemnity

You agree, on your behalf or if you are accessing our Services on behalf of a legal
entity, like your employer (see “Acceptance of Terms” above for more information) you
agree on behalf of that entity to the following terms:

You will be responsible for your use of the Services, and you agree to defend and
indemnify and hold harmless Streamlabs, and its parents, affiliates, subsidiaries,
partners, officers, directors, agents, contractors, licensors, service providers,
subcontractors, employees, and interns from any claims and demands made by any
third-party due to or arising out of your: (a) your access to or use of our Services,
(b) your content, (c) your violation of these terms or any terms incorporated herein
by reference, (d) your violation of applicable law or the rights of any third party.

Streamlabs reserves the right, at Streamlabs’ own cost, to take on the exclusive
defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you (and without
limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to that matter), and in that
case, you agree to cooperate with Streamlabs’ defense of that claim.

Limitation of Liability

NB. This section “Limitation of Liability” does not apply to Consumers resident in
the UK. For those Consumers, please refer to your country appendix.

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL STREAMLABS OR ITS
PARENTS, AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES, PARTNERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS,
CONTRACTORS, LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, SUBCONTRACTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND INTERNS BE
LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL

OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED APPLICATION,
HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE)
AND EVEN IF STREAMLABS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

IN NO EVENT SHALL STREAMLABS’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES (OTHER THAN AS
MAY BE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN CASES INVOLVING PERSONAL INJURY) EXCEED THE
AMOUNT OF FIFTY DOLLARS ($50.00).

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE-STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS
ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

Disputes

NB. This section “Disputes” does not apply to Consumers resident in the UK. For those
Consumers, please refer to your country appendix.

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND HOW CLAIMS THAT YOU
AND STREAMLABS HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.

Before you bring a legal proceeding, please reach out to customer support at
support@streamlabs.com. Most issues can be quickly resolved by contacting support.

We believe that arbitration is a faster, more convenient and less expensive way to
resolve any disputes or disagreements that you may have with us.

This Section is deemed to be a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the
Federal Arbitration Act. You and Streamlabs agree that we intend that this Section
satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. This Section can
only be amended by mutual written agreement.

Therefore, pursuant to these Terms of Service, if you have any dispute or
disagreement with us regarding (i) your use of or interaction with the Service, (ii)
any purchases or other transactions or relationships with Streamlabs, or (iii) any
data or information you may provide to Streamlabs or that Streamlabs may gather in
connection with such use, interaction or transaction (collectively, “Streamlabs
Transactions or Relationships”), you will not have the right to pursue a claim in
court, or have a jury decide the claim and you will not have the right to bring or
participate in any class action or similar proceeding in court or in arbitration.

By using or interacting with the Service, or engaging in any other Streamlabs
Transactions or Relationships with us, you agree to binding arbitration as provided
below.

We will make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints, disputes,
or disagreements that you may have with us.

If those efforts fail, by using the Service, you agree that any complaint, dispute,
or disagreement you may have against Streamlabs, and any claim that Streamlabs may
have against you, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with these
Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, or any Streamlabs Transactions or Relationships
shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (“Arbitration”)
administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer
Arbitration Rules then in effect (the “Applicable Rules”).

You can find a copy of the rules and more information at www.adr.org.

If AAA is no longer in existence, the Arbitration shall be administered by JAMS or
its successor ( “JAMS”) instead, and conducted in accordance with the JAMS
Streamlined Arbitration Rules And Procedures in effect at the time the Arbitration is
initiated or, if the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, in accordance with the
JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules And Procedures then in effect (which shall be
the “Applicable Rules” in such circumstances).. Information on JAMS can be found at
www.jamsadr.com.

If AAA (or, if applicable, JAMS) at the time the arbitration is filed has Minimum
Standards of Procedural Fairness for Consumer Arbitrations in effect which would be
Applicable to the matter in dispute, Streamlabs agrees to provide the benefit of such
Minimum Standards to you to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable
arbitration provisions set forth in this Section, provided, however, that in no event
may such Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the Application of subpart (d) or
(h) below. Furthermore, this Section shall not prevent any party from seeking
provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of Appropriate jurisdiction.

Furthermore, this Section shall not prevent any party from seeking provisional
remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

You further agree that:

a. Arbitrator Will Interpret This Agreement. The Arbitrator, and not any federal,
state or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any
dispute arising under or relating to the validity, interpretation, Applicability,
enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service and/or these arbitration
provisions in this Section hereof, including but not limited to any claim that all or
any part of these Terms of Service is void or voidable;

b. Location of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be held either: (i) at a location
determined by AAA (or, if Applicable, JAMS) pursuant to the Applicable Rules
(provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you and does not require
travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of business); or (ii) at such
other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and ; or (iii) at your election,
if the only claims in the arbitration are asserted by you and are for less than
$10,000 in aggregate, by telephone or by written submission;

c. Governing Law and Venue for Non-Arbitrable Disputes. These terms are governed by
(i) the United States Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and (ii) only to the extent
not inconsistent with the substantive and procedural provisions of the FAA, the laws
of the State of California, without regard to conflicts of laws principles.

The Arbitrator (i) shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; and (ii) shall
have authority to award any form of legal or equitable relief. The arbitrator will
not be bound by rulings in other related arbitrations. Any Disputes that are not
subject to the Arbitration Terms or that are severed from any arbitration may only be
litigated in the federal courts of Santa Clara County, California, provided that if
such federal courts decline to hear the Dispute, it may be remanded to the state
courts of Santa Clara County, California; and the parties consent to personal and
exclusive jurisdiction in these courts, except as otherwise provided by applicable
law.

d. No Class Relief. The Arbitration can resolve only your and/or Streamlabs’
individual claims, and the Arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain or
arbitrate any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join
the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;

e. Written Award. The Arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a statement
of decision setting forth the Arbitrator’s complete determination of the dispute and
the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (an “Award”). Judgment upon
the Award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having
jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets;

f. Arbitration Costs. In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of
Arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Streamlabs
will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the Arbitration
as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being
cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator
determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith;

g. Reasonable Attorney’s Fees. In the event you recover an Award greater than
Streamlabs’ last written settlement offer, the Arbitrator shall also have the right
to include in the Award Streamlabs’ reimbursement of your reasonable and actual
out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees associated with the Arbitration, but Streamlabs shall
in all events bear its own attorneys’ fees;

h. Interpretation and Enforcement of Arbitration Clause. With the exception of “No
Class Relief” above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be
invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Applicable Rules,
then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be
construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or
conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, “No Class Relief” is
found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration
provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Streamlabs shall be entitled to
arbitrate their dispute, and must instead bring any claims in a court of competent
jurisdiction;

i. Modification of Arbitration Clause With Notice. Streamlabs may modify these
arbitration provisions, but such modifications shall only become effective thirty
(30) days after Streamlabs has given notice of such modifications and only on a
prospective basis for claims arising from Streamlabs Transactions and Relationships
occurring after the effective date of such notification; and

j. Small Claims Matters are Excluded. No Class Relief or Joinder of Claims.
Notwithstanding the foregoing arbitration provisions, at your option, you may bring
any claim you have against Streamlabs in your local small claims court within the
U.S., if your claim is within such court’s jurisdictional limit; provided that such
court does not have the authority to entertain any claims on a class or
representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or
parties who may be similarly situated in such proceeding.\

Miscellaneous

NB. This section “Miscellaneous” does not apply to Consumers resident in the UK. For
those Consumers, please refer to your country appendix.

Entire agreement. These terms and any other terms incorporated by reference herein
cover the entire agreement between you and Streamlabs for your use of our Services
except where additional Streamlabs-provided terms apply to our products or services,
in which case the additional terms will control with respect to your use of that
product or Service to the extent of any conflict with these terms.

Our Relationship. Nothing in these Terms shall create or be deemed to create an
employment, partnership, agency, trust arrangement, fiduciary relationship or joint
venture between you and Streamlabs.

Waiver. If you do not follow these terms and we do not act immediately, we do not
give up or “waive” any of our legal rights, and we may exercise those legal rights in
the future.

Severability. If any part of these terms ends up being invalid or unenforceable based
on a decision by any court or competent authority, the rest of these terms will not
be affected. You may not assign these terms to anyone else without our written
consent. We may assign our rights to any of our affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any
successor in interest of any business associated with our services.

Appendix 1-UK to the Terms of Service
Supplementary Terms for UK Consumer Users

If you are a UK Consumer User, the Terms of Use shall apply to you with the exception
of the following deviations and supplementary terms.  If there is any inconsistency
or conflict between the Terms of Service and these supplementary provisions
(“Supplementary Terms”), the Supplementary Terms shall prevail.  

The Terms of Service are entered into by and between you and Logitech Services S.A.,
a Swiss company. You can contact us at: support@streamlabs.com. 

User Content

The fourth paragraph of Section 13 (Only Use Content You’re Allowed To Use) shall be
deleted and replaced as follows: 


By submitting your User Content, you agree that you have all rights, power and
authority necessary to grant the rights to such User Content as set out in these
Terms. As you alone are responsible for your User Content, you may expose yourself to
liability if you post or share User Content without all necessary rights.

Fees

The following wording will be added to the end of Section 18 (Fees) for UK consumers:

The fees for your subscription are set out during the order process (the “Fees”). The
Fees shall be in GBP and include the price for your subscription and any applicable
VAT and any other taxes applicable.

Fees shall be billed on a recurring basis, and your selected Services will
automatically be provided at the price and frequency you have chosen at the time of
your purchase.

You shall pay to us the Fees for the Initial Period upfront at the start of the
Initial Period, and you shall pay us the Fees for each subsequent Renewal Period
upfront at the start of each Renewal Period.

You may make payment using one of the payment methods set out in the order process.
When you place an order, you authorise recurring monthly or annual charges, as
applicable, on the payment method for the duration of your subscription including any
VAT or other taxes and late fees, as applicable that may be accrued by or in
connection with your subscription. You may be asked to provide certain information,
including your name, email, phone number, payment method details and billing address.

By making a purchase, you confirm that:

you have the legal right to use any payment method(s) used in connection with any
purchase; the information you supply in the process is true, correct, and complete;
and if you use a payment method that you are not authorised to use, you will be
liable to us for any losses that we suffer as a result of your use of that payment
method. You agree to provide current complete, and accurate purchase and account
information for all purchases made via the Platform. You agree to promptly update
your account and other information, including your email address and credit card
numbers and expiration dates, so that your transactions can be completed and you can
be contacted as needed.

We have the right to make changes to the fees for Paid-For Services from time to
time, although we shall not make any change to the fees applicable to you during the
current Initial Period or Renewal Period (as applicable). If these changes result in
an increase in the fees payable by you, we shall inform you at least thirty (30) days
in advance of the change. If you do not agree to pay the increased fees, you may
terminate your subscription in accordance with Section 5 of these supplementary terms
(“Termination”). 

If we need to change or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting
the e-mail, billing address and/or phone number that you provided during the order
process. A refund will be issued to your original payment method if payment has
already been taken on an order that we then cancel.

Cancellation rights – subscription contracts 

We will tell you when and how you can end a subscription during the order process and
we will confirm this information to you in writing after we have accepted your order.
You can also obtain advice about your right to cancel your subscription from your
local Citizens’ Advice Bureau or Trading Standards Office.

You have a right to cancel a subscription contract:

within fourteen (14) days of subscribing; and/or if you select a Service that
auto-renews at intervals of twelve (12) months or more, you will also have the right
to cancel within fourteen (14) days of such annual renewal date, and these are each
referred to as a “Cooling-Off Period”. 

If you are purchasing any digital products / content as part of your subscription
Services and you wish to access this during a Cooling-Off Period then you may do so
but:

you expressly agree that we may begin to make the digital content available to you
during the Cooling-Off Period; and you expressly acknowledge and agree that your
right to cancel your subscription as set out above will be lost. Some Services may
include a free trial period which will convert into automatic, recurring payments
after the period ends, as set out in the order process. If you cancel within the free
trial period, your free trial will not auto-renew into a subscription and you will
not be charged.

To exercise your right to cancel, you must inform us of your decision by making a
clear statement (e.g., by post or email). The easiest way to do this is to email us
at support@streamlabs.com. You may alternatively use the following model cancellation
form, which you can complete and email to us, but you are not required to use this
form:

Model Cancellation Form

To: Logitech Services S.A.E-mail address: support@streamlabs.com I/We(*) hereby give
notice that I/We(*) cancel from my/our (*) contract for the provision of the

for you to send your communication concerning the exercise of your right to cancel
before the cancellation period has expired.

In the context of Services, we may deduct from any refund an amount for the supply of
the Service for the period for which it was supplied, ending with the time when you
told us you had changed your mind. The amount will be in proportion to what has been
supplied, in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.

We will make the refund without undue delay, and no later than fourteen (14) days
after the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel your contract.

All refunds will be made using the same means of payment as you used for the initial
transaction and you will not incur any fees as a result of the refund. 

Cancellation rights – digital content 

In most cases, you will have a right to change your mind and cancel your contract
with us within fourteen (14) days of confirmation of your order without giving a
reason (the “Cooling-off Period”). This right may not always be available to you, for
example, in respect of:

services, once these have been performed or completed, even if the fourteen (14) day
cancellation period is still running (if you cancel after we have started but not yet
completed the relevant services, then you remain liable to pay us for the services
provided up until the time you tell us that you have changed your mind); or digital
products / content. If you are purchasing any digital content as part of your
Services and you wish to access this during a Cooling-off Period then you may do so
but: (i) you expressly agree that we may begin to make the digital content available
to you during the Cooling-Off Period; and you expressly acknowledge and agree that
your right to cancel your Services will be lost. To exercise your right to cancel,
you must inform us of your decision by making a clear statement (e.g., by post or

the Service for the period for which it was supplied, ending with the time when you

after the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel your contract.

All refunds will be made using the same means of payment as you used for the initial
transaction and you will not incur any fees as a result of the refund. 

Your other rights of refund 

You have legal rights in relation to Services that are not carried out with
reasonable care and skill, that are not priced reasonably (if you haven’t agreed a
price beforehand), or that are not performed within a reasonable timeframe (if you
haven’t agreed a timeframe beforehand). If you believe that any Services that you
have ordered do not conform with these terms, please contact our Customer Services
Team to request a re-performance (if possible in the circumstances) or a refund at
support@streamlabs.com.

Limitation of Liability

Section 26 (Limitation of Liability) does not apply to UK Consumer Users and shall be
replaced as follows: 

Nothing in these terms excludes or limits our liability for:

death or personal injury caused by our negligence; fraud or fraudulent
misrepresentation; and any matter in respect of which it would be unlawful for us to
exclude or restrict our liability. If we fail to comply with these terms, we are
responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breach
of these terms or our negligence, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage
that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it was an obvious
consequence of our breach or if it was contemplated by you and us at the time that
you accessed the Site.

Nothing in these Terms affects your statutory rights. Advice about your statutory
rights is available from your local Citizens’ Advice Bureau or Trading Standards
Office.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all warranties, express or
implied, as to the accuracy of the information contained in any of the materials on
the Site.

We have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business
interruption, or loss of business opportunity.

Whilst we make good faith efforts to include substantially accurate information in
the Services, errors or omissions may occur. If we receive notice of errors or
omissions, we will make reasonable efforts to correct them in due course; but
accuracy cannot be guaranteed.

We do not guarantee that the Platform will be totally secure or free from bugs or
viruses. You are responsible for configuring your information technology, computer
programmes and platform in order to access the Platform and we recommend that you use
your own virus protection software.

The Platform may from time to time contain links to third party websites. You are
responsible for deciding whether to access a third party website and your use of
third party websites will be governed by the terms and policies of that third party
website. We assume no responsibility for the content of websites or mobile
applications linked to from the Site (including links to our commercial sponsors and
partners). Such links should not be interpreted as endorsement by us of those linked
websites or mobile applications. We will not be liable for any loss or damage that
may arise from your use of them.

If you do not have a subscription Service: Our total liability to you for any loss or
damage arising out of or in connection with these Terms, whether in contract
(including under any indemnity), tort (including negligence) or otherwise shall be
limited to £100.

If you do have a subscription Service: In respect of your subscription, our aggregate
liability to you in respect of any loss or damage suffered and arising out of or in
connection with these terms, whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or
otherwise shall not exceed the greater of: (a) amount of the subscription Fees paid
by you for the Initial Period or Renewal Period during which the liability arose; and
(b) £100. 

Miscellaneous

Section 27 (Disputes) and 28 (Miscellaneous) do not apply to UK Consumer Users and is
replaced in their entirety by two new Sections as follows: 

Updates to these terms 

We may make changes to these terms from time to time and to the extent practicable we
will give 30 days’ days’ prior notice of any material changes and, for paid-for
subscription services, such changes will then take effect from the start of the next
Renewal Period, unless the change is due to a change in law or for security reasons
(in which case we may need to change these terms on shorter notice). Any use of the
Platform and/or the Services after the notice period will be deemed acceptance by you
of the changed terms. 

Governing Law and Jurisdiction 

These terms are governed by English law. This means that your access to and use of
the Platform, your purchase of any Services from us, and any dispute or claim arising
out of or in connection therewith (including non-contractual disputes or claims) will
be governed by the law of the State of California, in the United States of America. 

You may bring any dispute which may arise under these terms to, at your discretion,
either the competent court of England or to the competent court of your country of
habitual residence if this country of habitual residence is within the United
Kingdom, which courts are (with the exclusion of any other court) competent to settle
any such dispute. 

We shall bring any dispute which may arise under these terms to the competent court
of your country of habitual residence if this is within the United Kingdom or
otherwise the competent court of England.

If you are a Consumer and are resident in the United Kingdom and we direct the
Platform to (and/or pursue our commercial or professional activities in relation to
the Platform in) the country in which you are resident, you will benefit from any
mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident. Nothing in
these terms affects your rights as a consumer to rely on such mandatory provisions of
local law.

Additional Terms for Specific Products and Features
Beta Features and Products

From time to time we may provide access for products or features still in “beta
testing”, which means they are still in development and not fully released. They are
likely to contain errors. You agree that any beta products or features are provided
“AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.” You understand and agree that we may change, withdraw,
terminate your access to, testing of and/or use of, or discontinue any beta product
or feature (or any portion thereof) at any time and in our sole discretion, with or
without notice to you.

Use beta features and products only for testing and improvement purposes and in any
case not on a system or for purposes where the malfunction of the Beta Software can
cause any kind of damage. In particular, maintain full backups of any system that you
choose to install beta features or products on.

If you encounter any bugs while beta testing, please contact support@streamlabs.com
for assistance. Streamlabs may request or require that you provide suggestions,
feedback, or data regarding your use of the Beta software, which you grant Streamlabs
the right to use, dissect and repurpose at their sole discretion.

Product-specific terms and policies may also apply to your use of the Beta Product
(the “Product Terms”). In such case, Product Terms will be made available to you
(online or, prior to being made available online, as separately provided to you) and
will also apply to your use of the Beta Product. For clarity, once we post Product
Terms online (in the Platform Terms, in other supplemental terms, or otherwise), the
online version of such Product Terms will supersede any prior versions provided to
you. By continuing to access, test, or use the Beta Product after any modification to
the applicable Product Terms, you agree to be bound by them.

services of third parties and to work with other parties regarding those services.

Independent Contractors. Both Affiliate and Streamlabs agree that they are entering
into this Affiliate Terms as independent contractors and this agreement creates no
partnership, agency franchise, joint venture, sales representative or employment
relationship between them. You have no authority to accept or make any
representations or offers on the behalf of Streamlabs or its affiliates. You cannot
make any statements on your website or otherwise that would contradict anything in
this section.

Eligibility And Commission Terms.

Commission Amounts. The commission amount will be set described in the Affiliate Tool
or Affiliate Policies. We reserve the right to alter or change the Commission amount
at any time without advanced notice.

To be eligible for Commission:

(i) You will only be eligible for a Commission payment for any Customer Transactions
completed from the Affiliate Link that we make available to you and the Customer
Transaction is accepted by Streamlabs.

(ii) a Customer Transaction must have occurred,

(iii) a Customer must remain a customer during the locking period in the Affiliate
Tool (or if applicable, in the Program Policies).

You are not eligible to receive Commission or any other compensation from us based on
transactions for Other Products or if: (i) such compensation is disallowed or limited
by federal, state or local law or regulation in the United States or the laws or
regulations of your jurisdiction; (ii) the Commission payment has been obtained by
fraudulent means, misuse of the Affiliate Link, in violation of any Affiliate Program
Policies that we make available to you previously, or any misuse of the Affiliate
Tool or by any other means that we deem to breach the spirit of the Marketing
Affiliate Program.

Commission Terms. Affiliate will receive Commission for the initial user purchase
only. The Affiliate will not be entitled to receive Commission on any additional
purchases of Streamlabs Products by that same Customer.

In competitive situations with other affiliates, we will provide the Commission on a
“last-touch” basis, i.e. if a Customer clicks more than one affiliate’s referral
link, we will provide the Commission only to the affiliate whose link was used to
complete the Customer Transaction. We may discontinue Commission payments should any
of the eligibility criteria set forth in this subsection fail to be met at any time.

We will not pay more than one Commission payment or other similar referral fee on any
given Customer Transaction.

Taxes. You are responsible for payment of all taxes and fees (including bank fees)
applicable to the Commission. All amounts payable by us to you are subject to offset
by us against any amounts owed by you to us.

Commission, as well as the applicable conversion rate. In order to receive payment
under this Affiliate Terms, you must have: (i) agreed to the terms of this Affiliate
Terms (generally completed through the Affiliate Tool); (ii) completed all steps
necessary to create your account in the Affiliate Tool in accordance with our
directions, (iii) have a valid and up-to-date payment method in the Affiliate Tool
with such account (iv) completed any and all required tax documentation in order for
the Affiliate Tool to process any payments that may be owed to you. If any of these
requirements remain outstanding for six (6) months immediately following the close of
a Customer Transaction, then your right to receive Commission arising from any and
all Customer Transactions with the associated Customer will be forever forfeited
(each, a “Forfeited Transaction”). We will have no obligation to pay you Commission
associated with a Forfeited Transaction.

An Affiliate Lead will be considered valid and accepted if, in our reasonable
determination: (i) it is a new potential customer of ours, and (ii) is not, at the
time of submission or sixty (60) days prior, one of our pre-existing customers, or
involved in our active sales process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may choose
not to accept an Affiliate Lead in our reasonable discretion. If an Affiliate Lead
does not purchase the Subscription Service within the time period described on the
Affiliate Tool (or if applicable, in the Program Policies) of their first click on
the Affiliate Link, you will not be eligible for a Commission payment, even if the
Affiliate Lead decides to purchase after the time period has expired. An Affiliate
Lead is not considered valid if it’s first click on the Affiliate Link is after this
Affiliate Terms has expired or terminated. Engagement with Prospects. Once we have
received the Affiliate Lead information, we may elect to engage with the prospect
directly, regardless of whether or not the Affiliate Lead is valid. If an Affiliate
Lead is not valid then we may choose to maintain it in our database and we may choose
to engage with such Affiliate Lead. Any engagement between Streamlabs and an
Affiliate Lead will be at Streamlabs’s discretion.

(“Streamlabs” or “we”). Participation in the Program is subject to these terms and
conditions and Privacy Policy which are incorporated herein (collectively, the
“Program Terms”). The benefits and rewards outlined herein are provided in connection
with the use of the Streamlabs products.

Eligibility

In order to participate as a Program Member (defined below) in the Program you must
have a valid and active Streamlabs account. You may only have one Program account
(“Program Account”) and may not share memberships or have multiple memberships.
However, there may be more than one Program Member in a household. Memberships cannot
be merged or transferred. During the initial phases of the Program, Streamlabs may
make the Program available on a rolling or staggered basis such that not all
individuals will become eligible for the Program at the same time. By participating
in this Program you are agreeing to these Program Terms. If you do not agree to these
Program Terms, do not participate in the Program.

Membership Commencement and Tier progression

When an individual becomes a Program Member, they start in the Program Tier that
corresponds to the number of Program Points of their CCV. Each Program Member may
advance to the next Membership Tier by accruing the minimum number of Program Points
required for each Tier. Once the Program Member becomes eligible to move into a new
Membership Tier, the Program Member will see it become available to “unlock” within
their dashboard. The Program Member must click the “unlock” button to progress into
the new Membership Tier.

Bonus Points

At times, the Program may offer the Program Members certain opportunities to acquire
additional Program Points (“Bonus Points”) through enabling Streamlabs products and
completing certain tasks related to the Streamlabs products. Bonus Points tasks will
be listed within the Dashboard as a checklist with the number of Bonus Points
eligible for completing each task. Once the tasks are completed, the Bonus Points
will immediately be applied to your account.

Giveaways

No purchase or payment necessary to enter and win the Sweepstakes on Streamlabs
All-Stars (“Streamlabs”), and everyone who is eligible to enter has an equal chance
of winning. Streamlabs is the sponsor of all Sweepstakes (the “Giveaways”) hosted on
the Streamlabs website. The Giveaways are not sponsored, endorsed, administered by,
or associated with any other organization. These official rules apply to every
Giveaway campaign we run—but sometimes we also have extra information or
requirements. In those cases, we publish extra rules on the Giveaway campaign.
Usually those rules work with these, but occasionally, we may need to adjust some of
these rules for that campaign. We’ll tell you about those changes on the campaign
page. For full contest rules see Streamlabs All-Stars Contest Rules.

Account Termination

Participation in the Program is a privilege granted to Program Members, and as such
can be suspended, revoked, or terminated at any time by us for any reason. If your
Program Membership is terminated, all Points associated with your Program Membership
and any Membership Benefits will be forfeited immediately upon termination. If your
Program Membership is terminated due to fraudulent activity or noncompliance with
these Program Terms, or the Streamlabs Terms, in addition to forfeiting all Points
and Membership Benefits associated with your Program Membership immediately, you
cannot participate in or rejoin the Program.

Program Changes and Termination

We reserve the right to change or terminate the Program, or any part thereof, at any
time without notice and without further obligations to Program Members, including,
but not limited to modifications which: a) govern how Points are earned on and after
the date of change; or b) change the value of benefits. No Points will be earned or
redeemed after the effective date of termination. Any and all changes and/or
amendments to these Program Terms will become binding upon all members immediately.

We may offer HTTPS encryption for Your Sites. By registering a custom domain via the
Services, or pointing a custom domain to the Services, you authorize us to create and
maintain a certificate for the limited purpose of providing HTTPS for Your Sites.

Domains

This section explains how we provide our domain services. Your domain registrations
are also subject to agreements with third parties, including ICANN and our third
party registrar partners. We work with third party registrars to provide you with
domain services. When you register a domain name, or renew or transfer an existing
domain name, via the Services, you are bound by the relevant registrar’s terms and
conditions. Registrars are a Third Party Service, as defined below. Currently, the
registrar for the services on Creator Sites is Namecheap, and by accepting these
Terms, you also agree to be bound by Namecheap’s Terms located here and their Domain
Terms located here. In the future, we reserve the right to transfer the domains to
another domain registrar, or add additional domain registrars. This information will
be made available to users. Should you have any questions about domains, or your
domain, please email support@streamlabs.com

Email Hosting

Creator Sites offers email hosting services. Should you opt-in to these services, we
utilize a third party email hosting service, Mailgun to facilitate the forwarding and
outbounding of emails through an smtp server, to the email indicated at signup. You
agree to be bound by the terms of Mailgun located here and the Mailgun privacy policy
located here. The Creator Sites Services does not store or maintain copies of emails
or content on our site or servers.

Your use of our domain services is subject to the policies, including without
limitation the dispute resolution policies, of the Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers (“ICANN”). Your rights and responsibilities as a domain name
registrant under ICANN’s 2009 Registrar Accreditation Agreement are summarized here.
You can learn more about domain name registration in general here. Country code top
level domain names may not be subject to ICANN policies. In such cases, the
applicable policies are set forth in the Namecheap Terms.

Transfers, Renewals And No Refunds

Due to the complex nature of third party domain registrars, domain transfer requests
must be made manually to support@streamlabs.com. Domain transfers are not eligible
for refunds. For renewals, we or our registrar will try to provide you with notice
before your scheduled domain renewal date. However, you agree that renewing your
domain is solely your responsibility. We don’t offer refunds for domain renewals.

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, California residents have specific
rights around Logitech’s collection, use, and sharing of their personal information.
We do not sell your personal information, and we will not do so in the future without
providing you with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of that sale.

Logitech collects and uses various types of personal information when you use its
products and services, which are described within the Logitech Privacy Policy.

Logitech shares personal data with third parties for business purposes. Specifically,
here are the seven categories of activities for which we share data for business
purposes:

Auditing
Security

not used to build profiles)
Performing services
Internal Research
Testing or Product/Service Improvement

If you are a resident of California, you have the right to request to know what
personal information has been collected about you, and to access that information.
You also have the right to request that we delete your personal information, though
exceptions under the CCPA may allow us to retain and use certain personal
information.

You can learn more about how to submit a data rights request through contact details
located within this policy. An agent may submit a request on your behalf, but you
must provide proof that the agent is authorized to do so by providing the agent with
a signed letter giving permission to submit a request on your behalf and you must
confirm that authorization directly with us by sending an email to
privacy@logitech.com.

We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA.
Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not deny you goods or services, charge
different prices or rates, or provide a different service level for exercising your
privacy rights. However, we may offer certain financial incentives permitted by the
CCPA that can result in different prices, discounts or quality levels. Any incentive
we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and will only be
collected or processed with your consent.
